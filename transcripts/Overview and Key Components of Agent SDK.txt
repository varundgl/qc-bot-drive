5.53	7.41	SPEAKER	introduction to agent SDK
9.23	15.39	SPEAKER	what is agent SDK actually it is a software development kit
16.95	51.71	SPEAKER	toolkit for building autonomous AI agents automatic workable AI agents can be generated with the help of agent SDK which will always provide a platform a resource and tools and libraries in order to develop these AI agents then it will also help to create a flexible and reusable AI systems later it will enable the integration of certain goals tools and memory in agents
53.48	125.15	SPEAKER	so agent SDK plays a very important role in order to build an AI agent so this is a brief intro about agent SDK let's understand the key components of agent SDK what are the key components do we have first goal meaning a human is giving prompt to the AI system that is the goal for the AI system the requirement received from the user end terms to be the goal for the agent then tools what are the tools it will involve in order to create a specified result a relevant result tools lays an important role than memory after finding the results where it will store obviously in the memory so memory is also a key component of agent SDK then reasoning loop the chat that happens between the agent and the human or the user
126.98	228.99	SPEAKER	this is reasoning loop first i will ask agent or AI system hi how are you i will get a response i'm good how can i help you from the agent right so this conversation will go on please list top AI trends for twenty twenty five is the goal for example what are the tools the web search it will make the integrated apis into that AI system plays a role of tool memory first it will store it will search it will store five to six courses or trends with respect to the artificial intelligence it will list back end it will be stored in the memory then after storing what happens it will list the AI trends of twenty twenty five in the output screen once this is listed the user will try to change or tweak their particular prompt how they will change maybe this time data science oriented trends they're asking for a second goal now and sometimes they might also ask out of six trends which you have listed which is the best so again it will go to a thinking mode this reasoning will go on loop until unless the user exits from the AI system this is just a common example which i tried to give you in order to relate the key components of agent SDK
