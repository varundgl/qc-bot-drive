5.21	75.91	SPEAKER	now it's time to explore problem statement where it involves agent SDK and google SDK both of the use cases combined together in one program addressing one problem statement let's hop on to google collab and understand how the problem statement is listed and what is our solution how do we resolve the same let's quickly hop on to google platform here we are on the google collab platform addressing our problem statement which involves google SDK indeed agent SDK as well so what do we do here we are trying to build AI agent using google SDK to automate real time web search tasks what's happening here what's our objective we have to develop a simple autonomous AI agent that takes a user defined goal it performs a real time web search using google custom search API
77.59	150.19	SPEAKER	that is google SDK and presents relevant results to the user the agent should also retain memory of the past goals and result for reference so this is the objective and the problem statement basically we are trying to build an AI agent which will have a custom web search task on real time what are the key features of this it will accept the user defined goal that is a search query that's the prompt it will use google custom search API to fetch top search results that is the tool display the top three results including title URL and a snippet this is the result it will store the goal and results in the memory for future use also it will provide an option to refine the goal manually or conclude the session basically this is addressing in a manual perspective but serving the purpose of problem statement so these are the key features will be learning
151.96	226.03	SPEAKER	when we learn about this particular code then what is the expected outcome of this as i told you we have a goal we have a tool that is google custom search API action is nothing but searching for those particular top three results of the goal whatever it has been set and then displaying those three urls with title and snippet is the result then the real time search result deliver based on user inputs that's the expected outcome then a memory system that logs all goals and search outcomes during this session so this is the overall goal expected outcome and problem statement the features and objectives hope we are clear and set now let's understand the coding my codes are generally very self explanatory so it's easy to understand indeed i'll also be explaining how does these things work here
227.75	259.12	SPEAKER	first what do we do we install the required package what is the package that is google API python client we are using pip install and we are trying to install the required package then we have to import certain modules so we have to import from google API client we import which is called build that's the module we are trying to build the AI agent right
261.12	278.40	SPEAKER	now in order to interact we should know two important things one API key you have to replace with your own API key when you are working this is my API key which has been set search engine ID
280.59	314.32	SPEAKER	that is google search engine ID you can replace that with your own so that's why i have mentioned in the comment replace these two keys accordingly OK then we are sorted with API configuration now the question is where do i find the API key and where do i find the search engine ID i'll quickly give you a walk through where you can find and how you can generate then we will proceed with the further code
316.74	518.87	SPEAKER	let's understand how do we generate API key overall i'm just giving a gist of how do we do this first we have to go to google cloud there we have to select credentials once we select credentials you have an option to create credentials what kind of credential you can create let's see click on that you have different kinds of credentials available the first thing is API key click on the API key it will start creating your key ensure your particular API key is copied as and when it is created you can just copy this and paste it in a secure place right so once it's created you can close this if you want to see the API key you can click on show key it will show you that particular API key i'll close this if you want to edit something you can edit the API key here let's see what are the things we have here restrictions i've got no restrictions if you want certain websites to be restricted or certain i addresses restricted you can select them don't restrict key i have just put this across so it's by default i have not done anything it's just i've generated the API key and if you want to change the name you can change it here as well and save for now i'm not changing anything i'm just keeping as it is so you can copy that particular key go back and paste it here that is the API key now we have one more thing that is called search engine so what is the search engine ID where do we get this we will have a look at that as well you have to go to programmable search engine on google chrome you will get a screen like this there is no search engines created here first time we are creating so we'll click on create your first search engine once you do this you can give a name for your search engine what are the different sites you want to list you can list individual pages as well you can also list the parts of a site as well so what i'm doing i'm keeping it universal i'm keeping it WWW dot google dot com so the complete google search engine is customized so now we will enable image search and save search both so do not forget to click on add here once you do this see you have your particular URL listed here the website generally so i'm not a robot i'll just click this and you press on create once you do that you can see a preview here it's in the format of script right HTML script so you go to customize once you go to customize you will get a search engine ID copy this if you want URL you have an URL as well which is also ending with the same search engine ID you can see both are same now
520.51	539.59	SPEAKER	O what are the different search features enabled as by default it was image search save search if you want to search the entire web you can toggle this as well if you want to see any advanced all features of settings you can see here
541.32	772.23	SPEAKER	so query enhancement if you want to add keywords specifically you can add it so you have all these features available if you want to restrict certain pages you can restrict basically you can enable a custom google search engine that is what i meant to say so i think you're clear with how do you get your search engine ID so i'm just going back again just showing you this it is available in the code format as well if you want to describe you can give a description too you have to just copy the search engine ID get back to your code and replace in the relevant place here right this is about the API configuration which you have to set hope we are clear with this step now let's proceed with the next steps memory to store past goals and results whatever you search with the help of your custom google SDK it has to be stored right for that you have to create a open space the memory space after assigning a memory space next we have to define the tool function using google SDK why do we do this we have to ensure the google search is happening for the query which has been given it has to search with the help of what with the help of two things one the API key which is integrated and the search engine ID that search engine is not a normal open public search engine it is a custom google search engine which we have created and added that i'd into our code hope we are clear until here next we have to define the AI agents reasoning loop what is this reasoning loop it involves received goal the prompt which is received from the user then we will use google search tool which is created then we will display top three results it will have the result title URL and the snippet if any then we will store that in the memory with the help of memory append function we are trying to append the goal and the results so how many goals and results are stored that has been totaled total stored goals the numbers as been mentioned here next we are done with our goal tool and memory let's see what we can do next real time interaction i am just trying to give the real time feel of interaction with the SDK first it will state a welcome statement it will be printed then it will ask to enter your search goal what is your search goal for example top AI research labs in twenty twenty five i will be typing the same then we will run when you run what will happen it will go to the reasoning loop which we have created here right after it enters the reasoning loop it will finish all the assigned functions once it completes the execution of the functions in the reasoning loop it will show all the memory at the end so again you will have a for loop for that and we will try to list everything out so this is about the code of generating a custom search engine with the help of google SDK so the agent has been built let's run
776.53	785.57	SPEAKER	the output is this way let us try to take all the apis the google authentications everything
787.42	798.94	SPEAKER	it is asking enter your search goal after welcoming us to AI agent plus google SDK so i am typing the same top AI
801.69	810.91	SPEAKER	research labs in twenty twenty five OK i'm clicking on enter once i do that
813.06	869.11	SPEAKER	agent has received the goal that is top AI research labs in twenty twenty five the tool is searching in google for the same then the AI has got top three results what are these results as i mentioned it is having title URL and a snippet so here is the title result number one result number two and result number three so memory is stored goal and results total stored goals is one because i have given one single query right one single prompt so this is how it will list in the final memory log so this is how this particular code works when you integrate and try to understand how does an agent SDK key components and google SDK works
871.24	1125.11	SPEAKER	now there is one small constraint if you have observed or not i'm not sure but i'll try to explain what are the constraints do we have in this code first the agent operates only with the manual refinement no AI generated refinements available that's the fault that's the disadvantage search is limited to what google 's custom search API can return and it is having the quota limits it is restricted what do you do now you have a enhancement solution what all you can do let GPT also summarize the search results you can enhance this drawbacks by integrating open AI API key into the same code how do you do this how realistic it will be let's understand more about this we have old constraint that is the manual refinement issue now you can automatically add the GPT the agent becomes self sufficient it will think refine act that is search learn that is stores in the memory then what is the flow of execution for this first agent receives the goal simple it will search in google using the goal this is what we were doing it now additional step is refining goal using GPT so when you have given top AI research labs in twenty twenty five it will try to refine with the help of GPT leading artificial intelligence research institutes of worldwide twenty twenty five so this is a refinement that has been given to the goal which is already provided by the user it will search in the google again using GPT refined goal and it will store both the goals and results both of it will be stored accordingly we are not changing the execution flow we are just adding the GPT version in middle that's it that's the only enhancement we are doing in order to keep it in realistic manner the same code you have imports you have API keys you have memory store tool number one tool number two tool number one is google search tool number two here this is the addition open AI GPT for refinement this is the tool number two we have we have a function called refine query with GPT for that we have integrated few of the elements so we have kept the temperature max tokens is fifty so all these restrictions is also been put up and refined query also it will generate and give then the AI agent reasoning loop will start like before right it will again display the top three results then refine goal using GPT then display again the refine results so first it will display as it is the original then it will go towards the refined goal then it will create the result which is having the refined result so both of it will be stored in the memory so this is how this particular code will work with the enhancement of open AI API key now you have to see one important thing with API key and search engine ID we also have open AI API key integrated so when you do this you have to go to open AI platform again it is only towards the paid version of chatgpt or open AI so you can just go to open AI platform generate the API key there and paste it right here so this is how the code will look like you will get this particular code in your course just download try to replace all the API keys and run this particular code we have seen the use cases where we have integrated
1126.71	1160.83	SPEAKER	agent SDK and google SDK i mean agent SDKS key components the way it works it has been shown with the help of google SDK also there is a one small assignment you can just download this particular code try to execute the integration of open AI you can add the API key and try to run and check for the difference how realistic query looks like
