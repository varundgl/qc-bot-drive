Summary
Let's quickly recap: Agent SDK is a framework that helps create autonomous agents capable of performing tasks and interacting with external services. Key components include goals (objectives), memory (stores data), tools (external resources), and a reasoning loop (logic to decide actions). It allows agents to store information, interact with tools, and make decisions to achieve their goals autonomously. Agent SDK provides autonomy, modularity, and flexibility in task automation. Challenges include complex integration and debugging. Additionally, managing external resources can be difficult.
